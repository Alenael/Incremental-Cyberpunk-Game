# Incremental Cyberpunk Game

The idea is an incremental game where you make money, become stronger, and explore a futuristic cyberpunk world. You interface with the world via a terminal and can explore the world, find many activities to enjoy, and collect the 12 ancient artifacts.

# Work In Progress

Things are very much a work in progress.

# Story

In the year 2265, the world had become a vastly different place. After catastrophic event after catastrophic event, humanity had nearly been wiped out and the survivors were forced to ban together and work under massive corporations who had taken control of the world. Among these corporations was HelixTech, a company that had made a fortune in the field of neural implants and augmented reality. Almost all plant and animal life on Earth had been brought to the point of extention due to the heavy mining, pollution, and destruction of its natural resources.

One day, HelixTech's CEO, Dr. Marcus Helix, came up with an idea that would change the world forever. He proposed a revolutionary device that could extract the consciousness from a human brain and upload it to the cloud, where the individual could live out adventures virtually, forever. The device was called the CyberSoul, and it was a game-changer.

At first, the CyberSoul was only used to store the riches old and sick. You could call or even visit them virtually, but over time the technology became more available many more people decided they would rather live life virtually. There people were free and able to explore, play, hang out with friends, and do just about anything they could have ever wanted to. For the first time in their miserable lives many of them felt free and happy.

Over time though, as more and more people moved into the cloud, companies started to realize the potential money they could make by leveraging the cloud in ways no one had considered. One such company was Synergenix, a rival of HelixTech. TechCorp had been working on an android prototype for years but with the assistance of HelixTech they were able to connect the android to the cloud. The android was controlled by the consciousness, allowing the individual to explore the real world again, but with the added benefits of being able to upgrade their body and perform superhuman feats. This new technology, the ability to store your consciousness in an android, became known as HelixShell.

# Present Day:

Hundreds of years has now passed since the creation of this technology and you have just woken up inside the cloud. Do you make money, gain power, become a hero for the people? What you do is up to you.
